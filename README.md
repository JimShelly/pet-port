# pet-port

Pet-port is an application for the pet rescue industry.  In order to find stray and orphan pets a forever home sometimes these animals have to be transported out of state.  

I'm writing this application based off my wife's experience as a volunteer driver for a few of these transports.  

The idea is to make organizing transports easier by allowing multiple rescues to collaborate on a transport.  

These rescues will select the animals they wish to go to transport.  These animals get put into a "transport queue". 

When creating a transport, the user puts in a limit to the number of animals that can fit on the transport.  The animal rescue orgs then fill those slots with animals they wish to go on these transports.  

Another challenge in doing a transport is sometimes there are multiple legs of a trip.  These are typically for single animals or a small set of animals.  This will allow each volunteer to know when their end of the leg ends and if the other driver is at the drop-off spot.
